# LDPC_Decoding_for_5G_NR
LDPC codes are forward error correcting, which means they can efficiently correct transmission errors in noisy channels. Coding schemes in 5G technology provide increased speed and reliability, which allows developers to create applications faster and more responsively.
Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a class of linear block codes that were first introduced by Gallager in his PhD thesis in 1960. The name comes from the characteristic of their parity-check matrix which contains only a few 1’s in comparison to the amount of 0’s. 
Their main advantage is that they provide a performance which is very close to the capacity for a lot of different channels and linear time complex algorithms for decoding. Furthermore, they are suited for implementations that make heavy use of parallelism.
We represents LDPC codes by Tanner Graphs-a bipartite graphical structure. It contains two types of nodes in the graph: Check nodes & Variable nodes. Each Check node follows (n, n-1) SPC code. Each Variable node follows repetition code.
